# UDP-Client-Server-Example

## Repository Overview

This repository holds a demonstration of UDP communication established between a server and client. The server is a persistent program that should be started prior to client execution. Once the server is listening, the client can ping the server over an available port. The client program first takes user input to include in the request to the server. The server recieves this request, conerts to upper, and writes the content back to the client. The client recieves the response and outputs it  to console.

Following this, start the server on an open port `./server 4005`

Once the server logs 'listening...', open a new terminal.
